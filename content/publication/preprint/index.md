abstract: The paper explores how improving data interoperability can enhance litter monitoring by increasing data quality and quantity. It addresses the current scarcity of waste-related information and examines the opportunities and challenges of data interoperability. The paper presents digital solutions from the PREVENT Waste Alliance and discusses their interoperability potential. It also develops best practices for harmonizing data, summarized in a Toolbox for practitioners, and offers recommendations for greater engagement, data literacy, and partnerships. This work aims to support the waste management sector in becoming more data-driven and contributes to the circular economy ecosystem.
